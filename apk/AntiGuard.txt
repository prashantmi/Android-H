AntiGuard is an Android app I wrote that will assist you in unlocking a phone.

Since ADB doesn't always give you root, you might be limited in what you can do. However, the standard ADB shell user is also very powerful.

 * AntiGuard is now built into the regular toolset!

 * To install AntiGuard, you simply need to run
   * `adb install AntiGuard.apk`

 * To unlock the screen once install
   * `adb shell am start -S io.kos.antiguard/.unlock`

 * To uninstall, hit the uninstall button, or run this command
   * `adb uninstall io.kos.antiguard`
